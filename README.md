I always wanted to make a Serial terminal of my own as i work with a bunch of embedded system projects, 
so thats the main motivation for this project. I started with the base code that I found on Code Project
which is called "CodeProjectSerialComms" thanks to the author. 

Well now its modified to Ultimate Serial Terminal. Yoo Hoo 

I still have a lot of features i want to add but this is definitely a start. Well enjoy and contribute :)
